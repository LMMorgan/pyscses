    "Below, the resistivity ratio has been calculated for the system where defects are specific to their sites, there is a site with two positively charged defects, followed by two sites which each have one negatively charged defect. The central positively charged defects have a segregation energy of -1.0 eV and the negatively charged defects are fixed to their bulk mole fractions under the Mott-Schottky approximation. The figure below shows the grain boundary resistivity for the system at a range of temperatures between 773.15 K and 1273.15 K. The resistivity decreases as temperature increases as expected.  "
