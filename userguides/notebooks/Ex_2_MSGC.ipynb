As the negatively charged ```defect_2``` are fixed to its bulk positions they are not electrostatically attracted to the positively charged grain boundary core caused by the segregation of the positively charged ```defect_1```. This causes a larger electrostatic potential at the grain boundary core as the segregation is not limited by the repulsion of the negatively charged defects adjacent to the core and also a broader potential profile as the negatively charged defects are not shielding the positive potential."
