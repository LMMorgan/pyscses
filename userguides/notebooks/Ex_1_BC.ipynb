These defects are equal and opposite in their valence and therefore the system is charge neutral. For simplicity, all of the defects have a segregation energy of zero, except the central positively charged defect which has a segregation energy of -1.0 eV. As there are positively charged defects and negatively charged defects at each site the model is treated as a continuum model where any defect can occupy any site.

    "When using Dirichlet boundary conditions the potential at the boundary sites is fixed to 0.0. It can be seen from the figure above showing the potential against the $x$ coordinate, with this example using data which depicts alternating sites, the potential profile curves. This happens because no matter what the potential is calculated to be, the potential is forced to zero at the boundaries. In this example, the boundary sites are occupied by negatively charged defects and therefore these sites should have a slightly negative potential. The Dirichlet boundary conditions force these sites to have a potential of zero and therefore the potential profile curves. The change in the potential profile effects the charge density, causing the system to become negatively charged, losing charge neutrality. \n",
