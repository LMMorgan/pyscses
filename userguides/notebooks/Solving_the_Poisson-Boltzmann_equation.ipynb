    "The Poisson-Boltzmann equation can be solved numerically using a finite dfference approximation for the second order partial differential equation. To solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically, the second order partial derivatives need to be replaced with second-order finite difference approximations using Taylor series expansion. The differential equations then become a system of linear algebraic equations, which can be solved using matrix algebra.\n",

    "In this work, the sites described are the one-dimensional projection of defects in a crystal lattice onto a grid. In real crystals, lattice sites are not necessarily equally spaced and therefore the finite difference equations must be defined to take into account different $\\Delta x$ spacings.\n",
