    "This example uses real data generated for the 111 grain boundary orientation in gadolinium doped ceria ( $\\mathrm{Gd-CeO_2}$ ). The data was generated using METADISE which is a computer program that performs atomic scale simulations of crystal structures. These simulations allow dislocations, surfaces and interfaces to be studied. METADISE has been used to study a number of grain boundaries in gadolinium doped ceria and individual defect energies and positions were calculated for gadolinium ions at cerium sites and vacancies at oxygen sites.

    "When the calculation is run on this real system, the bulk mole fraction of each defect species in the output is less than the desired bulk mole fraction for each defect, therefore a correction is required to ensure that that bulk mole fraction of each defect in the output is what it should be. \n",
    "To achieve this, an array of 8 different mole fractions between [0.01, 0.04] and [0.0875, 0.35] (as defined above) are used as the input for the calculation at each temperature and a `bulk_region_x_min` and a `bulk_region_x_max` selected so there is no grain boundary effects. Once the calculation has been completed for each of the mole fractions at a given temperture, a linear regression is performed on the input mole fraction against the output mole fraction. Once the slope and intercept has been obtained the mole fraction required as input to give the desired mole fraction as output can be calculated. This is done for each temperature and the results stored in an array called mole fractions (overwriting the original array)."
